A versioned portable roaming shell environment.

Setup
-----

1) Clone this repo (You may want to fork it first.)

Read/Write:
$ git clone git@github.com:0xfe/evil.git

Read-Only HTTP:
$ git clone http://github.com/0xfe/evil.git

2) Edit env.sh and configure the tomato, most importantly setting EVIL_HOME.

export EVIL_HOME=~/c

3) Source dotfiles/bashrc.include.sh into your bashrc. You can add your
customizations to that file (e.g., in setup_mac).

source ~/c/env.sh
source $EVIL_HOME/dotfiles/bashrc.include.sh
setup_common

Alternatively, you can keep custom .bashrc files for each of your machines in
dotfiles/ and source them in from (or symlink to) your .bashrc. Make sure that
these custom files source in bashrc.include.sh.

source ~/c/env.sh
source $EVIL_HOME/dotfiles/bashrc.`hostname`

4) Symlink to the other configuration files.

$ ln -s $EVIL_HOME/dotfiles/screenrc .screenrc
$ ln -s $EVIL_HOME/dotfiles/vimrc .vimrc

5) Add the relevant cronjobs to your crontab. (Make sure your SSH keys are
exported to allow for non-interactive repo updates.)

$ crontab -e
(Edit crontab)

$ crontab -l
0,15,30,45 * * * * ~/c/cron/update_local_repositories.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
